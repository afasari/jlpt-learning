## Start with the Foundations

Before diving into vocabulary and grammar, master the absolute basics. This will make everything else much easier.

### 1. Master Hiragana and Katakana First

This is CRITICAL. Don't skip this step!

**Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks
**Practice Method**:
- Write each character 20-30 times
- Say the character while writing
- Use mnemonics (memory tricks)
- Practice daily for 15-30 minutes

**Resources**:
- [Hiragana Chart](/cheatsheets) - Quick reference
- [YouTube: Japanese Ammo with Misa](https://www.youtube.com/c/JapaneseAmmowithMisa) - Excellent teaching
- Anki deck: "Hiragana and Katakana" (recommended)

### 2. Learn Basic Greetings and Phrases

Start with high-frequency phrases you'll use daily.

**Essential Greetings**:
- おはようございます (Ohayou gozaimasu) - Good morning (polite)
- こんにちは (Konnichiwa) - Hello / Good afternoon
- こんばんは (Konbanwa) - Good evening
- さようなら (Sayonara) - Goodbye

**Use these immediately** in conversations, even if you're not fully fluent.

### 3. Learn Numbers and Time

These appear constantly in Japanese daily life.

**Numbers 1-10**:
- 一 (ichi), 二 (ni), 三 (san), 四 (yon), 五 (go), 六 (roku), 七 (nana), 八 (hachi), 九 (kyuu), 十 (juu)

**Time Expressions**:
- 時間 - time
- 一日 - one day
- 週 - week
- 月 - month
- 年 - year

**Practice**: Count everything you see (items on a desk, people in a room, train stops)

### 4. Focus on High-Frequency Words

Don't try to learn every word. Focus on the most common 100-200 words first.

**Top N5 Categories to Learn First**:
1. **Family members**: 父、母、兄、妹 (father, mother, older brother, younger sister)
2. **Food**: 飯べ物、水、ごはん (rice, water, rice)
3. **Body parts**: 目、耳、手、足 (eye, ear, hand, foot)
4. **Basic verbs**: 食べる、行く、見る (eat, go, see)
5. **Adjectives**: 大きい、ちいさ、高い、安い (big, small, expensive, cheap)

These 100 words will give you the foundation to understand and participate in basic conversations.

### 5. Use Audio Resources

Your brain needs to hear Japanese to learn it properly.

**Daily Listening** (15-30 minutes):
- [NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) - Even if you don't understand everything, get used to the rhythm
- [Japanese Pod 101](https://www.japanesepod101.com/) - Beginner-friendly podcasts
- [Erin's Challenge](https://www.erin.jlpt.jp/) - Video lessons with transcripts

**Active Listening Tips**:
- Don't just listen passively
- Repeat after the speaker (shadowing)
- Take notes on key words
- Focus on understanding the gist, not every word

### 6. Set Realistic Daily Goals

**Consistency beats intensity**. Study 30 minutes daily is better than 5 hours once a week.

**Daily N5 Routine** (30 minutes):
- 10 min: Hiragana/Katakana practice
- 10 min: Vocabulary (2-5 new words)
- 10 min: Grammar (1 new pattern)

**Weekly Goals**:
- Learn 10-15 new kanji
- Master 2-3 new grammar points
- Review all content from previous week

### 7. Don't Worry About Perfection

**N5 is about foundation**. Focus on understanding basic concepts, not perfect pronunciation.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Trying to memorize words without context - always learn with example sentences
- Learning too much vocabulary at once - stick to 5-10 new words per day
- Skipping Hiragana/Katakana - this will handicap your learning
- Only studying grammar - vocabulary and kanji need equal attention

### Recommended N5 Study Resources

**Books**:
- **Genki I** - The gold standard for beginners
- **Genki Workbook** - Practice exercises

**Online Resources**:
- **Tae Kim's Guide** - Free, comprehensive grammar explanations
- **JLPT Sensei** - Practice tests and exercises

**Anki Decks**:
- **JLPT Tango N5 1000** - High-quality vocabulary deck
- **Genki Vocab Deck** - Aligned with the textbook

### Next Steps After N5

Once you're comfortable with N5 content (after 3-4 months):
1. Move to **N4 level** - build upon your foundation
2. Start using **graded readers** - simple stories for your level
3. Increase **listening practice** - native-speed content
4. Consider a **language exchange partner** - HelloTalk, Tandem

**Remember**: JLPT is cumulative. Your N5 knowledge will be tested on the N4 test, so solidify your N5 foundation before advancing.
