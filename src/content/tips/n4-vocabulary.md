## Spaced Repetition is Key

Use Anki or another spaced repetition system to memorize vocabulary efficiently. The science of spaced repetition shows that reviewing information at increasing intervals dramatically improves retention.

### Tips for Effective Anki Use
- Keep daily new cards to 10-20
- Don't skip reviews - consistency matters
- Make your cards meaningful, not just word-to-translation
- Add example sentences to every card

## Learn Words in Context

Never learn isolated words. Always study vocabulary with example sentences.

### Example
Instead of just:
- 本 ほん (n) book

Study:
- 本 ほん (n) book
  - 本を読みます (I read a book)
  - この本は面白いです (This book is interesting)

This approach teaches you:
- How the word is used in sentences
- Common collocations (words that often go together)
- Proper pronunciation in context

## Study by Word Family

Group related words together. This creates memory connections and helps you learn faster.

### Example: 学 (gaku) family
- 学生 (gakusei) - student
- 大学 (daigaku) - university
- 勉強 (benkyou) - study
- 科学 (kagaku) - science
- 数学 (suugaku) - mathematics

## Use Mnemonics

Create memorable stories for difficult words. The more vivid or ridiculous the story, the better you'll remember.

### Example
勉強 (benkyou) - study
- "Ben" (a person) "kyo" (sounds like "cow") studying hard
- Picture Ben studying with a cow!

## Focus on JLPT Frequency

Study words in order of their appearance on the JLPT test. Resources like the Tango series organize vocabulary by JLPT frequency.

### Recommended N4 Vocabulary Resources
- Tango N4 1000 words
- Genki II vocabulary lists
- Sou Matome N4 vocabulary

## Practice Daily Usage

Try to use new vocabulary in your daily life.

- Write journal entries using new words
- Talk to yourself in Japanese
- Post on language exchange apps
- Label items in your home with Japanese words

## Review Previous Levels

Don't forget N5 vocabulary! The JLPT builds on previous levels. Regularly review from all levels you've studied.
