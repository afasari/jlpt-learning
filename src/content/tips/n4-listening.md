## Daily Exposure

Listen to Japanese content every day, even if it's just for 15-30 minutes. Your ear needs constant exposure to get used to the rhythm and intonation of Japanese.

### Recommended Resources
- NHK Easy News - Listen while reading the text
- Japanese podcasts - Great for background listening
- Anime and dramas - Watch with Japanese subtitles first, then without

## Active Listening Techniques

Don't just let audio play in the background. Actively engage with what you hear.

1. **Take notes** - Write down key words, numbers, and names
2. **Pause and replay** - Listen to difficult sections multiple times
3. **Summarize** - Try to summarize what you heard in your own words
4. **Shadowing** - Repeat what you hear immediately, mimicking speed and intonation

## Shadowing Practice

Shadowing is one of the most effective techniques for improving listening and speaking.

1. Listen to a short audio clip (10-20 seconds)
2. Immediately repeat what you heard, trying to match the speed and intonation
3. Practice this 5-10 times with the same clip
4. Gradually increase the length and difficulty

## Test Day Strategy

During the N4 listening section:

- **Read questions first** - Before the audio plays, read all the questions and answer choices
- **Note key information** - Write down numbers, times, names, and alternatives mentioned
- **Don't panic** - If you miss something, focus on the next part
- **Use context** - Even if you don't understand every word, the context often gives clues
- **Trust your first instinct** - Don't second-guess yourself

## Recommended Listening Resources

- **NHK News Web Easy** - Clear, slow news
- **Erin's Challenge** - Video-based listening practice
- **JapanesePod101** - Structured lessons with audio
